					<h2>Description Matrix</h2>
					
						<img src="assets/img/Matrix.png" alt="">
						An abandoned hotel, a woman (later revealed to be Trinity) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees the scene, pursued by the police as well as a group of mysterious suited Agents. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.

Computer programmer Thomas Anderson, known in the hacking scene by his alias "Neo", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the concept of "the Matrix." Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers he seeks.

The Agents, led by Agent Smith, apprehend Anderson and threaten him into helping them capture the "terrorist" Morpheus. Undeterred, Anderson later meets Morpheus, who offers him the choice between two pills; the red one to show him the truth about the Matrix, and the blue one to return him to his former life. After Anderson swallows the red pill, his reality disintegrates. Neo awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar.

As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity, Morpheus explains the truth. In the 21st century, there was a war between humans and intelligent machines. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' bioelectric power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century.

					<h2>Reviews</h2>
					<div class="review_name">Smith</div>
					<div class="review_text">During Agent Smith's interrogation of Morpheus, he speaks of humankind's tendency to use up all of the resources in an area and then multiply and spread. He says that the only other organism to do this is a virus. But he, of all characters in the film, would surely know that a virus is not an organism.</div>


					<div class="review_name">Alternate Versions</div>
					<div class="review_text">In the French version, when Neo dies, Trinity says that she loves him and that she is going to bring him back. In the original version she says that she is not afraid anymore because she loves him.</div>
